	<p>Hi there,</p>	
	<p>I'm a 23 year old Python/JavaScript/Ruby/whatever-is-needed programmer. I've explored a wide range of fields from kernel hacking to web application development. Here are a couple of things that I'm proud of:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>I created a chrome extension which gives definition for English word and have about 100 active users weekly.</li>
		<li>I led a team of four people and aced a project-heavy class.</li>
		<li>I wrote a program to search flight tickets and got a great deal home.</li>
		<li>When I was junior, I joined a research project consisting of two graduate students and became the lead programmer in the end.</li>
		<li>Ubuntu is my default operating system.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In my last semester at USC, I was hired to create a website for a research group at USC. I set up Grunt to automate the workflow and saved a lot of development time. And the supervisor highly appreciated the code readability and maintainability. In the mean time, I worked in an early stage startup (<a href="http://tutorme.com">tutorme.com</a>) for a while and revamped the homepage and sign-up for alpha launch. I also taught myself Ruby on Rails and did a project using it. (<a href="https://github.com/haohany/rails-project">github.com/haohany/rails-project</a>)</p>
	<p>I like your startup environment and would like to be in. I currently live in LA and would be happy to have a talk to know each other better.</p>

	<p>Best,</p>
	<p>Haohan</p>
