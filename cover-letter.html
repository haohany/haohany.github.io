  <p>Hi there,</p>  
  <p>I'm a 23 year old Ruby/Python/JavaScript/whatever-is-needed engineer. I've explored a wide range of fields from kernel hacking to web development. Here are some interesting facts about me as a programmer:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I love the web and wanna make it better. I learned both front end and back end by doing various projects.</li>
    <li>I like the feeling when I saw my program is being used by other people. I've been spending hundreds of hours of my free time building utility apps that are useful in the real world.</li>
    <li>I am obsessive about challenging problems. If I go to bed without coming up with an elegant solution, it will go into my subconsciousness and wake me up early in the morning.</li>
    <li>I have a compulsive desire to convert indentation to spaces.</li>
    <li>I use Ubuntu and avoid Windows as long as I can.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In my last semester at USC, I was hired to make a website for a research group. The supervisor spoke highly of the readability and maintainability of my code. In the meantime, I worked in an early stage startup (<a href="http://tutorme.com">tutorme.com</a>) for a while and revamped the homepage and sign-up for alpha launch.</p>
  <p>In my free time, I created a chrome extension which gives definition for English word and have about 100 active users weekly. I also wrote a program to search for flight tickets and got a great deal home.</p>
  <p>I was attracted by your technology stack and company culture. I want to be part of it. I've attached my resume.</p>

  <p>Best,</p>
  <p>Haohan</p>
